## Code architecture for CSS
* BEM (http://getbem.com/naming)
* SMACSS (https://smacss.com)

### BEM
The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS.
* When we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which modifiers and children already exist.
* When we are reading the markup instead of CSS, we can quickly get an idea of which element depends on another.
* Designers and developers can consistently name components for easier communication between team members.

### SMACSS
SMACSS stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS.
* Ease of demonstration and handover
* Ease of reading
* Scalable for all projects
